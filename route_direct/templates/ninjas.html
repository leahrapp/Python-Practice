<div><h1>NINJAS! {{ninja}}</h1></div>

<div ><p>A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び) was a covert agent
        or mercenary in feudal Japan. The functions of the ninja
        included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination
        and guerrilla warfare.
        Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were
        deemed dishonorable and beneath the
        samurai, who observed strict rules
        about honor and combat. The shinobi
        proper, a specially trained group of spies
        and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th
        century during the Sengoku period,
        but antecedents may have existed as
        early as the 12th century
